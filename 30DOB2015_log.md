To the Wedge Co-op & back. Awkward sidewalk stint to avoid crossing Lyndale twice. 82 degrees. 
To Haskell's for white wine. By bike = not choosing the lazy big box walking distance wine shop. 
A chilly jaunt to Dunn Bros by Loring Park to look out the window at Babe's pretty silhouette against the pond backdrop.
Set up the bike trainer with riser block for the first time. Smooth and satisfying.
