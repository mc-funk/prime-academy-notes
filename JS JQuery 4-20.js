$(document).ready(function (){
	alert("Yup, jQuery loaded!");
});
//document.ready function: runs as soon as page is ready
//bling notation is a JQuery specific action saying "I'm doing something with JQuery"
//In order for this to work: document.ready function must work correctly, 
//document must be ready, jQuery must be installed
